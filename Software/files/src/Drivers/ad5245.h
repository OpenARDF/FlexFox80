 * AD5245: 256-Position I2C®-Compatible Digital Potentiometer
 * http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD5245.pdf
 *
 * The AD5245 provides a compact 2.9 mm × 3 mm packaged solution for 256-position 
 * adjustment applications. These devices perform the same electronic adjustment 
 * function as mechanical potentiometers or variable resistors, with enhanced resolution, 
 * solid-state reliability, and superior low temperature coefficient performance.
