Introduction
============

This is the documentation for the LED blink delay example on AVR128DA48 Curiosity Nano

Example Description
===================

This example demonstrates simple toggling on a LED connected to PC6 with a period of 1 second implemented through the use of an interrupt generated by the overflow of TCA0.
